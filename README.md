Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd flow-to-dashboard-ready

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm install

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## Two-Way Sync Workflow

### Understanding the Sync
- Lovable.dev automatically syncs with GitHub
- Changes in Lovable.dev are automatically committed to GitHub
- Local changes need to be manually pushed to GitHub

### Best Practices for Sync
1. **Before Making Changes**
   ```bash
   # Always pull latest changes
   git pull origin main
   
   # Check status
   git status
   ```

2. **During Development**
   - Choose one environment (Lovable or Local) for each feature
   - Document which environment you're using
   - Avoid simultaneous edits in both environments

3. **After Making Changes**
   - Review changes before committing
   - Use appropriate commit message format
   - Test changes in both environments

## Development Environments

### Lovable.dev Environment
- **Best for:**
  - Quick prototyping
  - AI-assisted development
  - Visual editing
  - Rapid iterations
  - Team collaboration

- **Limitations:**
  - Limited to web interface
  - May have platform-specific constraints
  - Automatic commits

### Local Development Environment
- **Best for:**
  - Complex features
  - Custom configurations
  - Advanced debugging
  - Performance optimization

- **Setup:**
  ```bash
  # Clone repository
  git clone <repository-url>
  
  # Install dependencies
  npm install
  
  # Start development server
  npm run dev
  ```
