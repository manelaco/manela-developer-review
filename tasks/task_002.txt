# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema with proper relationships and RLS policies
# Details:
Create tables: companies (id, name, domain, status, branding_config, created_at), users (id, email, role, company_id, status, onboarding_completed, created_at), audit_logs (id, user_id, action, details, timestamp), sessions (id, user_id, start_time, end_time, activity_data), content (id, title, type, company_id, created_by). Implement RLS policies for each table ensuring proper tenant isolation. Create indexes for performance optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Test RLS policies by attempting cross-tenant data access, verify all relationships work correctly, and validate schema constraints

# Subtasks:
## 1. Schema Design and Planning [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design comprehensive database schema for multi-tenant architecture including entity relationships, data isolation strategies, and security considerations
### Details:
Create detailed schema diagrams, define tenant isolation approach, plan data partitioning strategy, document security requirements, and establish naming conventions for multi-tenant database structure

## 2. Table Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create all database tables according to the designed schema with proper data types, constraints, and tenant isolation columns
### Details:
Implement core tables with tenant_id columns, set up proper primary keys, foreign key constraints, check constraints, and ensure all tables support multi-tenant data isolation requirements

## 3. Relationship Establishment [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Establish foreign key relationships and constraints between tables while maintaining tenant data isolation
### Details:
Create foreign key constraints that respect tenant boundaries, implement cascading rules, establish junction tables for many-to-many relationships, and ensure referential integrity within tenant contexts

## 4. RLS Policy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement Row Level Security policies to enforce tenant data isolation and access control
### Details:
Create RLS policies for each table to restrict data access based on tenant context, implement user role-based access controls, test policy effectiveness, and ensure no data leakage between tenants

## 5. Indexing Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Create optimized indexes for multi-tenant queries and performance enhancement
### Details:
Design composite indexes including tenant_id for efficient tenant-scoped queries, create performance indexes for frequently accessed columns, implement partial indexes where appropriate, and analyze query execution plans

## 6. Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Comprehensive testing of database setup including tenant isolation, performance, and security validation
### Details:
Test tenant data isolation, validate RLS policy effectiveness, perform load testing for multi-tenant scenarios, verify index performance, test backup/restore procedures, and document all test results and performance benchmarks
