# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React frontend and Supabase backend configuration
# Details:
Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite. Set up folder structure for multi-tenant dashboards (superadmin, hr-admin, employee). Initialize Supabase project and configure environment variables. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configuration. Create basic routing structure with React Router for different dashboard types.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully, environment variables load correctly, and basic routing works for all three dashboard types

Database integration review completed successfully. Supabase PostgreSQL backend is fully operational with strict RLS enforcement. Client configuration verified in src/lib/supabaseClient.ts using VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY environment variables. Health check utility implemented in src/lib/db.ts testing both _health and onboarding_users tables. Core database tables confirmed: onboarding_users, companies, roles, and content. Onboarding flow includes company and role creation logic. Migration management via Supabase CLI is version controlled. No schema modifications required - database ready for continued development.
